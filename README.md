## Introduction

This repository is part of the submission for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project of the Data Science Course given by John Hopkins University through Coursera.

Given you unzip the data from this <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"> dataset</a>, and the unzipped folder is in your current working directory.

Write a Script that:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Additionally, create a repository (this repository) with the following files:
1.1 run_analysis.R
1.2 tidydata.txt
1.3 README.md
1.4 Codebook.md


# Files
##  run_analysis.R
The script that follows the assignment's steps in R code.
##  tidydata.txt
The output of the script.
##  README.md
(This File).
## Codebook.md
A detailed description of the variables, data, and transformations done to them.
